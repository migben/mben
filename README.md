# Dev Landing Page

This is a Minimal landing page styled for developers like me.


## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

I wanted a dev landing page to showcase everything I do online and I wanted it to be minimal and right to the point rather beautiful and hefty. And I think most of the devs out there would want the same.

### Custom Domain

If you want to make your new landing page available under a domain like `{username}.com` you can get started here - [Setting up a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/).
